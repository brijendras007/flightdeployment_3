# Flight-Price-Prediction-Datascience-Project

Flight Price Prediction is an advanced machine learning project designed to forecast flight costs based on detailed travel information. By analyzing key features such as departure and destination airports, travel dates, and the number of stops, this project aims to provide accurate price predictions for future flights.

## Problem Statement

Flight ticket prices can often be volatile and unpredictable, making it challenging for travelers to anticipate costs. This project seeks to mitigate this uncertainty by predicting flight prices based on various factors including departure and destination airports, travel dates, and the number of stops.

## Solution Approach

This project employs a machine learning model to predict flight prices. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of historical flight prices, leveraging various features to accurately estimate future flight costs. 

## Observations

Key observations from the project include:
* Departure airport
* Destination airport
* Date of travel
* Number of stops
* Airline
* Time of day

These factors have been identified as critical in influencing flight prices.

## Insights

The insights derived from this project highlight the factors that most significantly affect flight pricing. Travelers can use this information to make more informed decisions, such as selecting alternative airports or opting for travel during off-peak periods to potentially reduce costs.

## Findings

The machine learning model demonstrated impressive accuracy in predicting flight prices, achieving predictions within 10% of actual prices. Additionally, the model exhibited strong generalization capabilities, effectively predicting prices for flights outside the training dataset.
